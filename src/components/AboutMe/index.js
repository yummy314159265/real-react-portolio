                    I am a full stack web developer with a passion for coding and an appetite for learning. Growing up, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a computer, and when I finally got one for my 11th birthday, I've never gone a day without using one. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Now, my interest goes beyond simply using a computer â€” I love getting into the nuts and bolts, discovering just what this thing can do. I've taught myself a lot on my own, and have supplemented that with a wonderful bootcamp that taught me MERN stack. With my skills, I believe I can build any website you can dream up!
